# Blog Post App

I created this blog app for myself, with the intention of documenting my honest opinions and coding journey as I work on my skills. Blogging to document your life, is a wonderful way to reflect. Past joys and past mistakes, can all be learned from to some extent. So having somewhere to store those memories, can help you see how far you’ve come and how much you’ve learned.
